                <p class="lead">India decided to go to space when Indian National Committee for Space Research
                    (INCOSPAR) was set up by the Government of India in 1962. With the visionary Dr Vikram Sarabhai at
                    its helm, INCOSPAR set up the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in
                    Thiruvananthapuram for upper atmospheric research.

                    Indian Space Research Organisation, formed in 1969, superseded the erstwhile INCOSPAR. Vikram
                    Sarabhai, having identified the role and importance of space technology in a Nation's development,
                    provided ISRO the necessary direction to function as an agent of development. ISRO then embarked on
                    its mission to provide the Nation space based services and to develop the technologies to achieve
                    the same independently.

                    Throughout the years, ISRO has upheld its mission of bringing space to the service of the common
                    man, to the service of the Nation. In the process, it has become one of the six largest space
                    agencies in the world. ISRO maintains one of the largest fleet of communication satellites (INSAT)
                    and remote sensing (IRS) satellites, that cater to the ever growing demand for fast and reliable
                    communication and earth observation respectively. ISRO develops and delivers application specific
                    satellite products and tools to the Nation: broadcasts, communications, weather forecasts, disaster
                    management tools, Geographic Information Systems, cartography, navigation, telemedicine, dedicated
                    distance education satellites being some of them.

                    To achieve complete self reliance in terms of these applications, it was essential to develop cost
                    efficient and reliable launch systems, which took shape in the form of the Polar Satellite Launch
                    Vehicle (PSLV). The famed PSLV went on to become a favoured carrier for satellites of various
                    countries due to its reliability and cost efficiency, promoting unprecedented international
                    collaboration. The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) was developed keeping in mind the
                    heavier and more demanding Geosynchronous communication satellites.

                    Apart from technological capability, ISRO has also contributed to science and science education in
                    the country. Various dedicated research centres and autonomous institutions for remote sensing,
                    astronomy and astrophysics, atmospheric sciences and space sciences in general function under the
                    aegis of Department of Space. ISRO's own Lunar and interplanetary missions along with other
                    scientific projects encourage and promote science education, apart from providing valuable data to
                    the scientific community which in turn enriches science.

                    Future readiness is the key to maintaining an edge in technology and ISRO endeavours to optimise and
                    enhance its technologies as the needs and ambitions of the country evolve. Thus, ISRO is moving
                    forward with the development of heavy lift launchers, human spaceflight projects, reusable launch
                    vehicles, semi-cryogenic engines, single and two stage to orbit (SSTO and TSTO) vehicles,
                    development and use of composite materials for space applications etc. Know more about ISRO's
